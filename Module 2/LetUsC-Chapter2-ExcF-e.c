/*
A library charges a fine for every book returned late. For first
5 days the fine is 50 paise, for 6-10 days fine is one rupee and
above 10 days fine is 5 rupees. If you return the book after 30
days your membership will be cancelled. Write a program to
accept the number of days the member is late to return the
book and display the fine or the appropriate message.
